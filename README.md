## GitHub Structure
1. **Elysian Directory** - This is where our code for our app is kept. You can download the repo to see the code in this directory or view on GitHub.
2. **Project_Documentation Directory** - This is where all the Documentation for the various Assignments are held. Our Agile Reference Stories, Agile Requirements Spreadsheet, our Project System Architecture, and our Elysian Questionnaire are housed here.
3. **Sprint_Documentation Directory** - This is where all the Sprint Requirements Artifacts are held. These PDFs are the detailed tickets that are done in a specific Sprint and are updated once the Sprint ends.
4. **Sprint_Releases Directory** - This is the updated Requirements Stack, with the requirements/tickets we committed to for the next upcoming Sprint.


**Note:** We have also created all the tickets done for the previous Sprint and all the upcoming tickets for the next Sprint in our Projects page in our GitHub.
